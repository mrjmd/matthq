            <p>I started thinking about building this site after attending a Homebrew Website Club meeting on Wednesday, August 28, 2019. I have zero design or styling skills but I decided to build from absolute scratch. It's already been a somewhat painful experience to realize just how out of date my CSS skills are. But hey flexbox is cool.</p>
            <p>My goal is to have this site as a dumping ground of sorts, hopefully where I can syndicate some kind of posts out to other spots like Twitter and maybe Facebook. That will likely involve moving hosts and further wiring as currently this site is completely static and hosted on Netlify for free. We'll see how much time I end up dedicating to this endeavor, but for now I've made a start.</p>
